# Text-Based-Game
## Objective

The objective of this open-ended lab is to allow students to explore, design, and develop a text based detective game using the relevant programming constructs covered so far.
The game should simulate a detective investigation where the player explores different
locations, interacts with suspects, collects clues, and ultimately solves the case by identifying the real culprit.
